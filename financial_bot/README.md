#README

This Readme file will give a rough breakdown on installation and deployment procedure


* Ensure you have both Ruby and Rails installed on your system. Use either RVM or Homebrew to handle the installtion to allow you to quickly change versions and update easily.

* Export the file directory for this project. 

* From terminal go to the project directory and type 'bundle install' this will install all gem files needed for the project. If at any point you are getting an error referencing a gem when trying to deploy on your local, first try to 'bundle install' before anything else.

* Once you have installed the gemfile open up a second window in terminal, go to the project directory and type 'rails server' or 'rails s' this is the command to run your local web server.

* Remember, using any form of versioning control system give you the ability to try things you are not 100% sure of without having to worry about losing your work. So experiment and have fun with it.
